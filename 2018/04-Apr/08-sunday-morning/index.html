            <div class="synopsis">
                8th of April 2018 - A visit to our local church
            </div>
        <div class="contents">
            <p>Carr13 and I attended the Church of Jesus Christ of Surbiton this morning. We intend to attend regularly so as to become part of the community and perhaps gain some points with the big man upstairs. The vicar is a nice enough man though a little quietly spoken and a bit of a stutter.</p>
    <p>His curate is a huge young man with a voice like a foghorn. He vigorously shook my hand on the way out, which is something I will make a note to avoid in future. By way of a joke I said said I wasn&#39;t aware Jesus came from Surbiton. He looked at me seriously and said that it is the church which is of Surbiton, not Christ. Then he went on about where Jesus was from in a very loud voice. Not quite knowing what to say I shook his hand again, and regretted it.</p>
    <p>On the way home Carr13 asked me what I made of the sermon. I said I had tried to listen but, being a bit of an architecture buff, I had been making a study of the church which was made up of pointed arches and so obviously Norman, or is it Saxon? Apparently the sermon was about giving 10% of your money to charity. I said that when I had 10% to spare I would consider it. She asked me how much I had put in the collection. I said I couldn&#39;t remember, though I could, having found myself a bit short of loose change.</p>
    <p>Bought all the Sunday papers on the way home - nothing interesting in them.</p>

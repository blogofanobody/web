                6th of April 2018 - Preparing to report the news as I see it
            </div>
        <div class="contents">
            <p>Since I intend to be first to comment on breaking news, I visited our local corner shop to buy the Saturday papers. I plan to buy at least 3 papers a day to get a good balanced coverage of the news. I introduced myself to the lady behind the counter but I couldn&#39;t understand her name. I will refer to her as Mrs PaperShop and will edit my blog later once I get her bill which I hope will have her name written on it.</p>
    <p>I bought the Guardian, the Times and the Sun. I asked for these three papers to be delivered every weekday at 7:40 am. as I catch the 8:40 to Waterloo and it will give me time to read them. Mrs PaperShop laughed and said her husband delivered papers but he didn&#39;t get up until 9:00 am. I explained that people all over the world would be reading my comments on the news so it was important that I get the papers on time. She said &quot;OK&quot; and wrote something on a scrap of paper. I am not feeling confident about this.</p>
    <p>At home I read through all three papers and there was not much in them.</p>
    <p>I discovered that reason we had no sound on the television is that someone (not me) had put it on mute. Watched a program called &quot;Murder Murder Murder&quot;. Both Carr13 and I felt it had too much violence in it.</p>
    <p>And so to bed (Pepys).</p>
